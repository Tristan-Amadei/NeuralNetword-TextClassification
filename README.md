# NeuralNetwork-TextClassification

In this project, I built and trained a neural network to classify people into different job categories, from what they had manually entered as they activities and tasks in their professional lives. 
The model uses a word embedding model, trained by Google. 
The NN was able to reach around 93.5% accuracy. 

The project's goal was to classify people's jobs directly from MS-Excel. Hence, I also coded a VBA script to use the trained neural network on the data directly from Excel. 

I did this project during an internship for a company that shall remain nameless. However, I cannot add to this repo the data I've worked with, not some other documents that are not public property. Hence, the code from this repo cannot be run. 
The goal was merely to show what has been done. 
Nonetheless, should you have any critics or advice, I'd be happy to hear them out :)
